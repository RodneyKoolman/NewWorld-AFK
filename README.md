# New World - AFK

Written in Python, freezed into stand-alone executable with PyInstaller. This app will make sure you stay in New World without getting kicked for inactivity.

It's simple, yet effective. Will sent out move, special and even mouse commands, in random combinations, to keep you in the game for as long as you want. To avoid being real obvious (like auto-run), it's sending at different times, lengths and combo's combined with mouse adjustments.

## New

### v2.0: refactored code, stability improvements, added timer and countdown, added mouse movement, removed special key presses (q,r,f), more natural movement with random movement lists and opening inventory.

## Download

- [Windows executable](https://github.com/RodneyKoolman/NewWorld-AFK/releases/download/v2.0/New_World_AFK_v2.exe "Windows executable")

**Note:** Windows may give a warning because the file is unknown and not trusted. This file is **safe** to use and you can click 'keep' and 'run anyway'.
