# New World - AFK
**Say goodbye to long queues.**

Written in Python, freezed into stand-alone executable with PyInstaller.
This app will make sure you stay in New World without getting kicked for inactivity.

It's simple, yet effective. Will sent out move and special commands, also in random combinations, to keep you in the game for as long as you want.
To avoid being real obvious (like autorun), it's sending at different times and combo's.

**Usage:**
1. Download and start the New World - AFK.exe executable;
2. Click start in the app;
3. Set and click your mouse once in the game;
4. The app is running and shows which commands it's sending;
5. Click stop to end.

*Hint: to get your mouse to show ingame, use tab (switch to inventory) and you can use your mouse to start New World - AFK.*

**Use this at your own risk. Feel free to use and change the app.**
